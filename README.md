																																							FVGâ€™s IN FOREX TRADING 


Aim of the Project:

	I am going to prepare a dsa210 project about the Fair Value Gaps in Forex Trading. Fair value gaps are commonly used by most of the trader as a smart Money concept which helps to predict price actions in both ways (bullish or bearish


 	Bullish FVG: A gap is formed at when the low of the third candle is higher than the high of the first candle.

 	Bearish FVG: A gap is formed at when the high of the third candle is lower than the low of the first candle


How we are going to approach ?

	 This Project will gather data from the Yahoo Finance embedded in the Python. Different time intervals in different time periods will be considered. Thus the accuracy of the data analysis will rise.

	Witht the help of Yahoo Finance embedded in python i wil get the data of different currency pairs (EURUSD,GBPUSD,USDJPY, etc.) time intervals will be like 30m-1h-4h-1d in time periods of 6 months and 1 year.

	Also different timezones and different aspects will be accounted in the data analysis. Such as gap length of the fair value gaps and the liquidity zones near the fair value gaps. We will observe them too in order to make our analysis strong.

	Also we are going to observer how many percents of the fair value gaps will be filled and what is going to be to optimal fill rate in a fair value gap. On the other hand bullish fair value gap will be observed in counter bias position and bearish fair value gap will be observed in counter bias position.
